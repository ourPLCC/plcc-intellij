# plcc-intellij
An Intellij platform plugin for PLCC.

This is a project I, ([@abacef](https://github.com/abacef)) will be developing for my Masters project during Fall 2020.

No idea where to start? Have a look at the installation instructions. Otherwise, look at the feature list. Each link has a tutorial.

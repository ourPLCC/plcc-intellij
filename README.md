# plcc-intellij
An Intellij platform plugin for PLCC.

This is a project I, ([@abacef](https://github.com/abacef)) will be developing for my Masters project during Fall 2020.

## Install and Run
The plugin is not yet on the JetBrains Plugin Marketplace, so you cant install it through there, but hopefully it will be soon.

In order to run the plugin from source:
- Check out the repo
- Open it with Intellij
- Right click on src/main/grammar/plcc.bnf and select 'Generate Parser Code'
- Right click on src/main/grammar/plcc.flex and select 'Run JFlex Generator'
- Click the run button at the top left of the IDE to run Gradle task :runIde

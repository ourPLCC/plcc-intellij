# plcc-intellij
An Intellij platform plugin for PLCC.

This is a project I, ([@abacef](https://github.com/abacef)) will be developing for my Masters project during Fall 2020.

The plugin is not yet on the JetBrains Plugin Marketplace, but hopefully it will be soon.

In the meantime, if you want to run it, simply check the repository out, open it with Intellij and press the run button (Gradle task :runIde)

Check out the [feature list](https://github.com/ourPLCC/plcc-intellij/wiki/Feature-List). Each link has a tutorial.
